Lab 1 - Input and conditionals 

The assignment: 
	Create a program that takes user string input and does the following: 
		checks the input against a preset string,
		If the string matches print "correct input",
		if the sting does not match print "incorrect input".

	Requirements: 
		The program should not error out no matter what input the user gives, 
		the program should NOT be case sensitive, 
		
	Example output: 

		Case 1, Correct input:
			Lab1.py - "please enter password"
			user    - "password"
			Lab1.py - "correct input"

		Case 2, Incorrect input:
			Lab1.py - "please enter password: 
			user    - "incorrect password"
			Lab1.py - "incorect input"


	Extra requirement: 
		The program should only take string inputs that contain 0-9, '_', and A-Z characters 
		If any strings have inputs that dont meet this critera the program should print "invalid input"
		Bonus points if you can impliment this using an Ascii chart 

		Example output: 

			Case 1, Invalid input:
				Lab1.py - "please enter password"
				user    - "pass word"
			``	Lab1.py - "Invalid input"

	if x == 95 or 48 <= x <= 57 or 97 <= x <= 122:
		is valid 
	else: 
		not valid
